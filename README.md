Welcome to [women.code(be)](http://bit.ly/wdcb-website), a community for women who code in Belgium. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª

women.code(be) is a national voluntary organisation by women who code for women who code that only operates in Belgium.
By undertaking various initiatives such as building an online community and organising events, women.code(be) is creating opportunities for (future) women who code. Opportunities to connect, grow, gain and share knowledge and to inspire girls and women throughout Belgium.

Another part of our mission is to put local role models in the spotlight to promote their skill and talent, in the hopes to inspire and push the Belgian tech industry towards becoming more accessible and inclusive.
